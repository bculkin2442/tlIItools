Add gem affix groups
	Essentially, things with names that differ only in a trailing
	number get arranged into a common group that displays together for
	ease of reading.

Add option to display zero-weight affixes

Add tagging of things w/ custom internal names w/ their file name

Add some sort of GUI?
	Add some more sorting/filtration abilities

	Add DB support
		Load/save to a SQLite database file instead of from .DAT
		files. This means having some kind of 'Import .DAT Files..'
		option.

		SQLite is chosen for being able to easily pass around data
		files.
