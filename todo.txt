Add support for displaying by groups
	This means arranging all of the affixes in a group
	together.

	This also probably means subordinating affix groups to file
	groups.

Add effect name tracking
	Essentially, I want a list of all of the effects with names
	attached to them, what the effect is, and the affix that it
	is attached to.

Add tagging of things w/ custom internal names w/ their file name

Add some sort of GUI?
	Add some more sorting/filtration abilities

	Add DB support
		Load/save to a SQLite database file instead of from .DAT
		files. This means having some kind of 'Import .DAT Files..'
		option.

		SQLite is chosen for being able to easily pass around data
		files.
